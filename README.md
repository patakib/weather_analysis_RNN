This is a <strong>time series forecasting project</strong> focusing on the weather data of Szeged, Hungary.  
Source file is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/budincsevity/szeged-weather  
  
The dataset consists of 10 years of weather data for this location on an hourly basis, including temperature, wind, humidity and pressure data among others.  
  
The main objective is to give a prediction based on the historical data.

I used some ideas from this article: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/weather-forecasting-with-recurrent-neural-networks-1eaa057d70c3
